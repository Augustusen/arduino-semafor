# Arduino Semaphore Project

This is an Arduino project where I simulate a traffic light (semafor). The project uses basic components like LEDs, resistors, and buttons to control the traffic light sequence.

## How it works:
- The Arduino controls the sequence of lights for the traffic light.
- It includes red, yellow, and green LEDs for different phases of the traffic light.
- The light sequence can be altered depending on inputs (such as a button press or time-based delay).

## Requirements:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LEDs (red, yellow, green)
- Resistors
- Jumper wires

## Installation:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Augustusen/arduino-semafor.git
   
2. **Upload files to Wokwi Arduino Simulator**:

- Go to Wokwi Arduino Simulator and create a new Arduino Uno project.

- In the Wokwi interface, go to the Library Manager.

- Delete any existing files in the Library Manager (if any).

- Upload all the .ino files from this repository by selecting the Upload file(s) option.

3. **Run the simulation**:

- After uploading the files, click the Start button to begin the simulation.

- You should now see the traffic light sequence working in the Wokwi simulator.

**Usage**:

- The traffic light will automatically cycle through red, yellow, and green lights.

- You can modify the sequence and timing in the code based on your requirements.
